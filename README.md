# @bridge-tools/config

This is the base configuration file for all of the `@bridge-tools` packages, to ensure they have consistent styling and such.

This package will be imported as a devDependency in each of the projects, so the tools are dragged in only when developing.

For more information about the `@bridge-tools` suite of packages, see the [core repository](https://github.com/bridge-tools/core).
